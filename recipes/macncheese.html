        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This pot of creamy, gooey, cheesy, glorious macaroni and 
            cheese - was made with 3 ingriedients in about 10 minutes</p>
        <p>Seriously. That's one fewer ingredient than you need to 
            add to the pot to make a box of Kraft macaroni and cheese.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>6 oz elbow macaroni</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>6 oz evaporated milk</li>
                <li>6 oz grated mild or medium cheddar cheese, or any good 
                    melting cheese, such as Fontina, Gruyere, or Jack</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place macaroni in a medium saucepan or skillet and add 
                    just enough cold water to cover. Add a pinch of salt and 
                    bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently. 
                    Continue to cook, stirring, until water has been almost 
                    completely absorbed and macaroni is just shy of al dente, 
                    about 6 minutes.</li>
                <li>Imediately add evaporated milk and bring to a boil. 
                    Add cheese. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring 
                    continuously, until cheese is melted and liquid has 
                    reduced to a creamy sauce, about 2 minutes longer. 
                    Season to taste with more salt and serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
